## Problem Statement
As global investors increasingly prioritize sustainability and responsible investing, access to 
reliable, real-time data has become crucial in making informed financial decisions. With the 
growing importance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, alongside the 
rapid changes in market sentiment driven by social media and news platforms, there is a need 
for an innovative tool that consolidates these insights into a single, easy-to-use platform. The 
key requirements are:
• A user-friendly application that delivers real-time sustainability and market sentiment 
data from credible sources, helping investors stay informed about the equities they 
follow.
• Enhanced decision-making capabilities for investors, made possible by an interactive 
dashboard that integrates diverse data analytics, giving them a holistic view of stock 
performance.
• Scalability for future enhancements, ensuring that the application can easily integrate 
additional data sources, features, or asset classes as investment needs evolve
